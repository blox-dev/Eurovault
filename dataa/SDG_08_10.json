indicator is calculated as the ratio of real GDP to the average population of a specific year. GDP measures the value of total final output of goods and services produced by an economy within a certain period of time. It includes goods and services that have markets (or which could have markets) and products which are produced by general government and non-profit institutions. It is a measure of economic activity and is also used as a proxy for the development in a country’s material living standards. However, it is a limited measure of economic welfare. For example, neither does GDP include most unpaid household work nor does GDP take account of negative effects of economic activity, like environmental degradation.","id":"SDG_08_10","agencyId":"ESTAT","version":"1.0","datastructure":{"id":"SDG_08_10","agencyId":"ESTAT","version":"38.0"},"annotation":[{"type":"DISSEMINATION_DOI_XML","title":"<adms:identifier xmlns:adms=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/adms#\" xmlns:skos=\"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core.html\" xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"><adms:Identifier rdf:about=\"https://doi.org/10.2908/SDG_08_10\"><skos:notation rdf:datatype=\"http://purl.org/spar/datacite/doi\">10.2908/SDG_08_10</skos:notation><dct:creator rdf:resource=\"http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/corporate-body/ESTAT\"/><dct:issued rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date\">2023-01-19T12:50:39</dct:issued></adms:Identifier></adms:identifier>"},{"type":"DISSEMINATION_OBJECT_TYPE","title":"DATASET"},{"type":"DISSEMINATION_PRESENTATIONS","title":"[{\"names\":{\"de\":{\"locale\":\"de\",\"value\":\"Standardpräsentation\",\"html\":false},\"en\":{\"locale\":\"en\",\"value\":\"Default presentation\",\"html\":false},\"fr\":{\"locale\":\"fr\",\"value\":\"Présentation par défaut\",\"html\":false}},\"descriptions\":{},\"code\":\"default\",\"useAsDefault\":true,\"order\":0,\"defaultView\":\"view.table\",\"jsonFormat\":null,\"preselection\":[{\"code\":\"freq\",\"multipleSelection\":null,\"singleSelection\":\"A\"},{\"code\":\"unit\",\"multipleSelection\":null,\"singleSelection\":null},{\"code\":\"na_item\",\"multipleSelection\":null,\"singleSelection\":\"B1GQ\"},{\"code\":\"geo\",\"multipleSelection\":null,\"singleSelection\":null}],\"preselectionTimeFilter\":{\"code\":\"time\",\"multipleSelection\":null,\"singleSelection\":null,\"mode\":\"ALL\",\"from\":null,\"to\":null,\"fixed\":null},\"layoutFormat\":{\"layoutAxes\":{\"y1\":\"time\",\"x1\":\"geo\"},\"fixedMinMax\":false,\"mapProjection\":null,\"mapShowAllGeo\":true,\"mapNumberOfColors\":0,\"rankingMode\":false,\"highlightMode\":false,\"labelOption\":null,\"businessRulesStrategy\":null,\"mapClassificartionMethode\":null}}]"},{"type":"DISSEMINATION_PRESENTATIONS_VERSION","title":"v0_4_X"},{"type":"DISSEMINATION_SOURCE_DATASET","title":"NAMA_10_PC"},{"type":"ESMS_HTML","title":"Explanatory texts (metadata)","href":"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/sdg_08_10_esmsip2.htm"},{"type":"ESMS_SDMX","title":"Explanatory texts (metadata)","href":"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/estat-navtree-portlet-prod/BulkDownloadListing?file=metadata/sdg_08_10_esmsip2.sdmx.zip"},{"type":"OBS_COUNT","title":"1791"},{"type":"OBS_PERIOD_OVERALL_LATEST","title":"2022"},{"type":"OBS_PERIOD_OVERALL_OLDEST","title":"2000"},{"type":"SOURCE_INSTITUTIONS","text":"Eurostat"},{"type":"UPDATE_DATA","date":"2023-03-08T23:00:00+0100"},{"type":"UPDATE_STRUCTURE","date":"2023-03-08T23:00:00+0100"}],"status":{"label":{"b":"break in time series","c":"confidential","d":"definition differs (see metadata)","e":"estimated","p":"provisional"}},"positions-with-no-data":{"freq":[],"unit":[],"na_item":[],"geo":[],"time":[]}}}
